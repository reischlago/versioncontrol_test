# versioncontrol_test
This is a test to try version control with Borka

New line added to the README file to try commit, by Atom.

Another new line via github.

Created new branch called "branch-for-agoston".

Adding more lines to the file, but only on the borka branch to see how it works, after I made some changes on the agoston branch.
